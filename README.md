# Finite State Machine (FSM) Based Navigation

## Overview

This repository presents the implementation of a custom differentia drive robot capable of performing **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), autonomous navigation** (with dynamic obstacle avoidance), and **mission execution** in a warehouse environment.

!https://github.com/iShuchi/Finite-State-Machine-Navigation/blob/main/media/demo.mp4

Packages Utilized:

* **2D Mapping** is performed using `slam_toolbox`
* **Localization and Navigation** is performed using `Nav2` stack
* **Mission execution** is performed using a custom **Mission Manager**.

## Execution

Perform git clone to place the given repository inside your workspace,
```bash
cd /workspace/src
git clone https://github.com/iShuchi/Finite-State-Machine-Navigation.git
cd ~/workspace
colcon build
```

Ensure following commands are added to the end of your .bashrc file,
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source ~/workspace/install/setup.bash
```

### Launch Mapping

```bash
ros2 launch diffdrive_bringup diffdriveMAP.launch.xml
```

### Keyboard Control (Teleop)

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

### Save the Map

```bash
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f src/navigation/diffdrive_description/maps/Warehouse
```

This generates an **occupancy grid** with .yaml and .pgm format.

## Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)

SLAM-Toolbox uses **graph-based 2D SLAM** approach.

### Mathematical Formulation

Each robot pose is represented as a node in pose graph, with constraints from:

The optimization problem:

[
\hat{x} = \arg \min_x \sum_{i,j} | z_{ij} - h(x_i, x_j) |^2_{\Omega_{ij}}
]

Where:

* z_{ij}= relative pose measurement
* h(\cdot)= motion model
* \Omega_{ij}= information matrix

Laser scan matching is performed using **correlative scan matching** to minimize drift errors.

## Mapping Additionals

To reduce drift during SLAM, I went through following settings:-

* **Linear velocity** ≤ `0.45 m/s`
* **Angular velocity** ≤ `0.43 rad/s`
* Avoid aggressive rotations
* Move slowly in narrow aisles and corners


## 🧭 Navigation & Localization (Nav2)

This section deals with use of Navigation Stack (Nav2).

### Launch Navigation

```bash
ros2 launch diffdrive_bringup diffdriveNAV.launch.xml
```

### Map Configuration

If a different map is used, update the following line in:

```
/home/laptop/delhivery_ws/src/navigation/diffdrive_bringup/launch/diffdriveNAV.launch.xml
```

```xml
<arg name="map" value="$(find-pkg-share diffdrive_description)/maps/Warehouse.yaml"/>
```

## 📍 Localization (AMCL)

Nav2 uses **Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL)**.

### Mathematical Model

The robot belief is represented by particles {x^k}_{k=1}^N.

Weight update:

[
w_k \propto p(z_t | x_k, m)
]

Particles are resampled based on likelihood computed using the LiDAR likelihood field model. Navigation stack uses **Global** and **Local Path Planners** to dynamically evaluate the path and avoid obstacles during navigation.

## 🤖 Mission Manager

Pickup, drop, and dock poses are defined by sending Nav2 goals and observing coordinates echoed in the topic:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /goal_pose
```

In the meanwhile, the locations.yaml stores the corresponding calculated yaw and x, y coordinates in location:

```bash
~/delhivery_ws/src/navigation/mission_manager/config/locations.yaml
```

## Mission Execution Flow (FSM)

1. Navigate to **Pickup**
2. Trigger pickup action/alert
3. Navigate to **Drop-off (Assembly Line)**
4. Trigger drop action/alert
5. Navigate to **Dock Station**
6. Wait for next mission (loop)


## Failure Handling (Edge Cases)

* If navigation to any waypoint fails:

  * Failure is reported
  * Mission is aborted
  * Robot **directly navigates to Dock**
* This behavior can be tested by providing unreachable coordinates in `locations.yaml`


## Navigation Additionals

To reduce drift and oscillations:

* Reduce **inflation radius** in `NAV2.yaml` to 0.05
* Reduce **maximum linear velocity (x-axis)** to 0.1

These changes improve path stability and localization accuracy.

## 🔮 Future Work

* More detailed FSM branches for multiple order permutations
* Sensor fusion using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
* Fleet Manager integration via ROS 2 actions
